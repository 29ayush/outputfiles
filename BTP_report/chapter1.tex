Board games are one the best way to test agents and reinforcement learing algorithm to test it viability. Example- chess is one of the complex game with state space of almost $10^{47}$ and decision tree of size $10^{123}$. Similarly state space complexity of connect4 is $10^{12}$ and decision tree of $10^{21}$. The task of this project is to improve the learning rate of the agents who are going to play these games. In this project various games have been chosen depending upon the computation requirement we have.

\section{Organization of The Report}

You can write the about organization of your report in the following manner.

This chapter provides a background for the topics covered in this
report. We provided a description of wireless ad hoc networks, and
their applications. Then we described the network model that
represents the topology of wireless ad hoc networks \cite{Omar2016}. In this
chapter it is shown that the virtual backbone for wireless ad hoc
networks can be represented by a connected dominating set. We
explained clustering concepts and lastly the difference between
centralized and distributed algorithms are also discussed. The
rest of the chapters are organised as follows: next chapter we
provide review of prior works. In Chapter 3 and 4, we discuss our
new algorithms for constructing small backbones for ad-hoc
wireless network. And finally in chapter 6, we conclude with some
future works.
